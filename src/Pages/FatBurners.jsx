                        end up in a lot of dessets. But they are low in all of the things that you want them to be like calorie, fat, and sodium. They have a good amount
                        of fiber. The fiber helps you feel full and keeps you from going mad in betweeen meals. It also helps keep things moving along degestively.
                        Just be sure to chew your apple up real well before swallowing and buy organic so you can leave the peel on it.

                        Then we got smart and realized that not all fat is created equally and good fats actually help you lose the fat you have. Try adding avocado

                    <i className="fa-solid fa-quote-left fa-3x"></i> No need to go on some whacky Grapefruit diet to get the benefits of it, but for most people this is going to require a new purchase at 
                store. Grapefruit doesn't tend to make it onto most people's shopping list, but it should be. In regards of weight loss the long standing 
                myth that they help you lose weight is being proven left and right by clinical studies, and you don't have to buy a fruit, you can simply 
                buy grapefruit juice and start drinking that instead. Tim Ferriss of the Four Hand Body says he uses grapefruit juice on his "free days" in 
                an effect to avoid the food he's eating from causing weight gain.

                    <i className="fa-solid fa-quote-left fa-3x"></i> Greek Yogurt has been getting attention as healthier farm of Yogurt. Thia is because it packs a bigger protien punch, with less sugar than 
                ordinary yogurt. But you don't have to give up regular yogurt altogether, and there are other foods that Greek Yogurt can fill in. For example 
                you can use it as a reasonable substitute for sour cream and shave off plenty of calories and fat grams. You can also use it in your baking to 
                replace other fats and oils, but this might take some trails and errors.
